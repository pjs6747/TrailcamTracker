# TrailcamTracker
Emails user the public ip address of a computer that uses the sd card from a trailcam. Trialcams are placed in the woods and used to record animals when motion is detected. These cameras are often stolen, so I created this program as a proof of concept to track the thief. Plan to add functionality to add any target email through a dialog box and to also hide the sign-in credentials present in the code to access the program's email address.
